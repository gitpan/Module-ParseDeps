NAME
    Module::ParseDeps - parse module dependencies from CPAN distribution

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.1 is required.

    The following modules are required:

      File::Spec
      Module::MakefilePL::Parse
      Test::More
      YAML

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::ParseDeps;

      $hashref = parsedeps('./Some-Module-Extracted-0.0/');

DESCRIPTION
    This module will scan a directory containing an extracted CPAN
    distribution for meta files (*.meta or META.yml) or Makefile.PL and
    parse those to determine which modules that distribution claims to
    require.

    It assumes that the distribution accurately notes required modules.

    More detailed information is available in the module documentation.
